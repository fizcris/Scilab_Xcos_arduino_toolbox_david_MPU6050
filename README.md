Scilab Xcos Arduino toolbox
=========================================

Serial Communication Toolbox for Scilab provided by David Violeau and improved by Cristian Alonso for use with Arduino UNO and MEGA. Tutorials and examples of apllication in the attached folder.

## Installation:
1. Download sketch _v4 into your arduino card. 
2. Copy arduino_svn into directory \contrib. 
3. At beginning of scilab go to menu Modules and select Arduino. (You can recompile if necessary by executing builder.sce but I think it is not necessary.)
4. You will have a new block called MPU6050 where you can tell which data get from card.

## Changes:

Arduino v4:
+ Support for MPU 6050
